# Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms repository! This README provides an overview of two fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.

## Introduction

Sorting is a common operation in computer science, and there are numerous sorting algorithms available. In this repository, we focus on two simple yet educational sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a straightforward comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed. While Bubble Sort is not efficient for large datasets, it is an excellent starting point for understanding sorting algorithms.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and putting it at the beginning. Selection Sort is easy to implement and is more efficient than Bubble Sort, especially for larger datasets.

## Algorithm

1.Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
2.Swap the found minimum element with the first element in the unsorted portion.
3.Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted subarrays one element to the right.
4.Repeat these steps until the entire array is sorted.
